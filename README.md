# Mahalanobis-Distance-Map-for-Network-Traffic

MDM helps in standardization and detecting of correlations between features
This will be an implementation for payload based Anamoly detection model given by Aruna Jamdagni
It will be implemented for Http traffic on a localhost

# Description
* Ngrams for payload (n=1)
* 256 dimension feature vector
* Relations between features
* Image classification model for the vectors
